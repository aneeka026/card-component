## card-component
This project uses **Bootstrap Card Components** for clean, responsive pricing sections.

- Cards include a header, pricing, feature list, and CTA button.
- Uses Bootstrap’s grid (`row`, `col-sm-5`, `col-md-3`) to keep cards flexible on all screen sizes.
- Buttons use Bootstrap’s `btn` utility classes.
- Example pricing: *Free*, *Pro*, *Enterprise*.
